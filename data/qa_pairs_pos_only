Initially producing 260 PS, it was one of the fastest cars of its time. A key innovation was the controlled valve on the exhaust side, which made the turbocharged engine more suitable for everyday driving.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the 993-generation 911 Turbo marked a significant milestone by introducing twin-turbocharging. With two small turbos positioned close to each cylinder bank, the engine could respond more quickly and delivered 408 PS, surpassing 400 PS for the first time.\n\nA major technological leap came in 2006 with the 997-generation 911 Turbo, which introduced variable turbine geometry (VTG) chargers\u2014a world-first in combustion engines. This innovation allowed for optimum use of the exhaust stream at all speeds, enabling dramatic power increases up to 700 PS in the GT2 RS model."

        "user_query": "How does the all-wheel-drive system in the 911 Carrera enhance performance?",
        "positive_answer": "The Porsche Traction Management (PTM) in the 911 Carrera's all-wheel-drive system enhances performance through an electronically controlled, fully variable multi-plate clutch that optimally distributes drive force between the rear and front axles. By continuously monitoring the vehicle's driving state through various sensors, the system can dynamically adjust torque distribution. For example, if the rear wheels are at risk of spinning during acceleration, more drive force is transmitted to the front axle. This results in increased driving stability, improved comfort, and enhanced athleticism across different driving conditions, including wet and snow-covered surfaces."
