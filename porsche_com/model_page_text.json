        "Chassis.PorscheActive Suspension Management (PASM).PASM is an electronic damping control system that actively and continuously adjusts the damping force on each wheel, based on current road conditions and driving style \u2013 for reduced body roll and thus for improved comfort and increased dynamics.PASM sports suspension.For the first time in the 911Turbomodels, a particularly high-performance PASM sports suspension in combination with a body lowered by 10mm is optionally available. With firm springs, adapted anti-roll bars and a new tuning of the PASM dampers, the PASM sports suspension enables a further improvement in dynamic performance. Without major restrictions on driving comfort.PorscheTraction Management (PTM).The system has been continuously enhanced. It is now more robust and offers improved control. The result: increased precision and resilience.PorscheTorque Vectoring Plus (PTV Plus).This system enhances vehicle dynamics and stability by applying brake pressure to the rear wheels, in conjunction with a rear differential lock. When the car is driven assertively into a corner, moderate brake pressure is applied to the inside rear wheel. Consequently, a greater amount of drive force is distributed to the outside rear wheel, inducing an additional rotational pulse (yaw movement) around the vehicle\u2019s vertical axis.PorscheStability Management (PSM).PorscheStability Management (PSM) is an automatic control system for maintaining stability at the limits of dynamic driving performance. Sensors continuously monitor the direction, speed, yaw velocity and lateral acceleration of the car. Using this information, PSM is able to calculate the actual direction of travel at any given moment and applies selective braking on individual wheels to restore stability.Rear-axle steering.Rear-axle steering enhances performance and suitability for everyday use in equal measure. The advantage for day-to-day driving: at low speeds, the system steers the rear wheels in the opposite direction to that of the front wheels. This leads to a virtual shortening of the wheelbase. The advantage for sporty driving: at high speeds, the system steers the rear wheels in the same direction as that of the front wheels.Front-axle lift system.The further development of the lift system on the front axle allows more ground clearance at the front of the 911Turbo. More precisely, by 40mm and up to a speed of approx. 35km/h. The system therefore ensures that kerbs, ramps and car park entrances are a sporting challenge of the past.PorscheDynamic Chassis Control (PDCC).PDCC is an active roll stabilisation system. It suppresses the vehicle's lateral body movement during dynamic cornering manoeuvres. A permanently controlled rolling torque distribution between the front and rear axles ensures that the handling is ideally adjusted for every driving conditions. For improved dynamic performance, even more neutral handling and increased ride comfort \u2013 whatever the speed.",

        "Assistance systems.PorscheWet mode.\u00b9Using sensors in the front wheel housing, the system detects swirled-up water spray, thereby assessing wet road surfaces. If it detects a noticeably wet road surface, the response behaviour of PSM and PTM is prepared accordingly. The system informs the driver of detected wetness and recommends that they switch manually to Wet mode. If the driver activates this, PSM, PTM, aerodynamics, PTV Plus and the responsiveness of the drivetrain are adjusted.\u00b9ThePorscheWet mode is not a substitute for adopting an appropriate driving manner in different road and weather conditions, and is, at the most, an aid for the driver.Collision and Brake Assist.The standard Collision and Brake Assist can reduce the risk of collisions with vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists within the limits of the system. In the first stage, the system uses the front camera to alert the driver both audibly and visually when it detects vehicles, pedestrians or cyclists in the collision area.Automatic distance control.Where system limitations allow, the system regulates the speed of your 911Turbofully independently in line with the speed of the vehicle in front. A radar sensor in the front apron monitors the area in front of your vehicle. If you have selected a cruising speed and begin to approach another vehicle that is travelling in the same lane as you and which is driving more slowly, the system slows the engine or gently applies the brakes. This continues until the distance that you have pre-set is attained.PorscheInnoDrive including automatic cruise control.\u00b9PorscheInnoDrive extends the range of functions of the automatic distance control system by up to three kilometres of anticipatory speed control. Based on high-precision navigation data as well as the radar and video sensor technology in the vehicle,PorscheInnoDrive can detect speed restrictions and the course of the road \u2013 before your 911Turboeven reaches them.In short:PorscheInnoDrive represents the typicallyPorscherealisation of efficient driving \u2013 for greater comfort and greater driving pleasure.\u00b9The assistance provided byPorscheInnoDrive is subject to system limitations. The driver must monitor driving style at all times and intervene in cases of doubt. The system can be overridden at any time by use of the brake or accelerator pedal.Lane Keeping Assist including traffic sign recognition.Lane Keeping Assist uses a camera to detect the divider line markings where system limitations allow. The system supports the driver with steering assistance when the vehicle approaches a detected divider line marking and threatens to leave the lane, thus helping to keep the car on track. Integrated traffic sign recognition uses camera images and navigation data to detect speed limits, \u2018no overtaking\u2019 zones and indirect information, such as boundary signs, and displays these in the instrument cluster.Lane Change Assist with Turn Assist.Within system limits, Lane Change Assist uses radar-based technology to monitor the area behind your 911Turboand blind spots. If the system detects a vehicle approaching quickly from behind or one that is in the blind spot, and changing lanes would be too dangerous, it informs the driver with a visual signal in the exterior mirrors. For greater comfort and safety, especially on the motorway. Turn Assist provides support during low-speed turns. Once you've arrived at a junction, Turn Assist issues a visual warning if it detects objects in your blind spots.Night Vision Assist.Night Vision Assist provides you with information when driving at night, even beyond the range of the headlights within the system limits. An infrared camera detects pedestrians or large wildlife before they are illuminated. A thermal image in the instrument cluster warns you: the detected person or animal is highlighted in yellow \u2013 or in red and is accompanied by an audible signal if within the critical range in front of the vehicle. At the same time, the stopping distance control is activated.ParkAssist (front and rear) including reversing camera.The standard reversing camera facilitates precise reverse parking and manoeuvring. Help is provided in the form of the camera image and dynamic guidelines on the PCM screen, which illustrate the predicted course of the vehicle given the current position of the steering wheel.Remote ParkAssist.\u00b9The Remote ParkAssist combines a variety of intelligent assistance systems that make it easier for you to find suitable parking spaces as well as parking itself. Thanks to the Active Parking Assistance, when activated and at the appropriate speed, your 911Turbois able to measure and identify possible parking spaces as you drive past, and \u2013 monitored by the driver \u2013 independently takes over the steering and the forward and reversing manoeuvres of the vehicle during the parking process.\u00b9Only compatible withAppleiPhones from iPhone 7 generation and from iOS 13.0. Please see the compatibility instructions in the Car Configurator. All systems function within their system limits and the driver must constantly monitor the vehicle.Surround View.Surround View supplements the reversing camera with three more high-resolution cameras in the front apron and exterior mirror lower trims. Based on the information supplied by all four cameras, the system generates a virtual bird\u2019s eye view of the car and displays this on the PCM screen. It is also possible to switch between various camera views to improve visibility, e.g. at narrow exits."

        "Assistance systems.PorscheWet mode.\u00b9Using sensors in the front wheel housing, the system detects swirled-up water spray, thereby assessing wet road surfaces. If it detects a noticeably wet road surface, the response behaviour of PSM and PTM is prepared accordingly. The system informs the driver of detected wetness and recommends that they switch manually to Wet mode. If the driver activates this, PSM, PTM, aerodynamics, PTV Plus and the responsiveness of the drivetrain are adjusted.\u00b9ThePorscheWet mode is not a substitute for adopting an appropriate driving manner in different road and weather conditions, and is, at the most, an aid for the driver.Collision and Brake Assist.The standard Collision and Brake Assist can reduce the risk of collisions with vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists within the limits of the system. In the first stage, the system uses the front camera to alert the driver both audibly and visually when it detects vehicles, pedestrians or cyclists in the collision area.Automatic distance control.Where system limitations allow, the system regulates the speed of your 911Turbofully independently in line with the speed of the vehicle in front. A radar sensor in the front apron monitors the area in front of your vehicle. If you have selected a cruising speed and begin to approach another vehicle that is travelling in the same lane as you and which is driving more slowly, the system slows the engine or gently applies the brakes. This continues until the distance that you have pre-set is attained.PorscheInnoDrive including automatic cruise control.\u00b9PorscheInnoDrive extends the range of functions of the automatic distance control system by up to three kilometres of anticipatory speed control. Based on high-precision navigation data as well as the radar and video sensor technology in the vehicle,PorscheInnoDrive can detect speed restrictions and the course of the road \u2013 before your 911Turboeven reaches them.In short:PorscheInnoDrive represents the typicallyPorscherealisation of efficient driving \u2013 for greater comfort and greater driving pleasure.\u00b9The assistance provided byPorscheInnoDrive is subject to system limitations. The driver must monitor driving style at all times and intervene in cases of doubt. The system can be overridden at any time by use of the brake or accelerator pedal.Lane Keeping Assist including traffic sign recognition.Lane Keeping Assist uses a camera to detect the divider line markings where system limitations allow. The system supports the driver with steering assistance when the vehicle approaches a detected divider line marking and threatens to leave the lane, thus helping to keep the car on track. Integrated traffic sign recognition uses camera images and navigation data to detect speed limits, \u2018no overtaking\u2019 zones and indirect information, such as boundary signs, and displays these in the instrument cluster.Lane Change Assist with Turn Assist.Within system limits, Lane Change Assist uses radar-based technology to monitor the area behind your 911Turboand blind spots. If the system detects a vehicle approaching quickly from behind or one that is in the blind spot, and changing lanes would be too dangerous, it informs the driver with a visual signal in the exterior mirrors. For greater comfort and safety, especially on the motorway. Turn Assist provides support during low-speed turns. Once you've arrived at a junction, Turn Assist issues a visual warning if it detects objects in your blind spots.Night Vision Assist.Night Vision Assist provides you with information when driving at night, even beyond the range of the headlights within the system limits. An infrared camera detects pedestrians or large wildlife before they are illuminated. A thermal image in the instrument cluster warns you: the detected person or animal is highlighted in yellow \u2013 or in red and is accompanied by an audible signal if within the critical range in front of the vehicle. At the same time, the stopping distance control is activated.ParkAssist (front and rear) including reversing camera.The standard reversing camera facilitates precise reverse parking and manoeuvring. Help is provided in the form of the camera image and dynamic guidelines on the PCM screen, which illustrate the predicted course of the vehicle given the current position of the steering wheel.Remote ParkAssist.\u00b9The Remote ParkAssist combines a variety of intelligent assistance systems that make it easier for you to find suitable parking spaces as well as parking itself. Thanks to the Active Parking Assistance, when activated and at the appropriate speed, your 911Turbois able to measure and identify possible parking spaces as you drive past, and \u2013 monitored by the driver \u2013 independently takes over the steering and the forward and reversing manoeuvres of the vehicle during the parking process.\u00b9Only compatible withAppleiPhones from iPhone 7 generation and from iOS 13.0. Please see the compatibility instructions in the Car Configurator. All systems function within their system limits and the driver must constantly monitor the vehicle.Surround View.Surround View supplements the reversing camera with three more high-resolution cameras in the front apron and exterior mirror lower trims. Based on the information supplied by all four cameras, the system generates a virtual bird\u2019s eye view of the car and displays this on the PCM screen. It is also possible to switch between various camera views to improve visibility, e.g. at narrow exits."

        "Chassis.PorscheActive Suspension Management (PASM).PASM is an electronic damping control system that actively and continuously adjusts the damping force on each wheel, based on current road conditions and driving style \u2013 for reduced body roll and thus for improved comfort and increased dynamics.PASM sports suspension.For the first time in the 911Turbomodels, a particularly high-performance PASM sports suspension in combination with a body lowered by 10mm is optionally available. With firm springs, adapted anti-roll bars and a new tuning of the PASM dampers, the PASM sports suspension enables a further improvement in dynamic performance. Without major restrictions on driving comfort.PorscheTraction Management (PTM).The system has been continuously enhanced. It is now more robust and offers improved control. The result: increased precision and resilience.PorscheTorque Vectoring Plus (PTV Plus).This system enhances vehicle dynamics and stability by applying brake pressure to the rear wheels, in conjunction with a rear differential lock. When the car is driven assertively into a corner, moderate brake pressure is applied to the inside rear wheel. Consequently, a greater amount of drive force is distributed to the outside rear wheel, inducing an additional rotational pulse (yaw movement) around the vehicle\u2019s vertical axis.PorscheStability Management (PSM).PorscheStability Management (PSM) is an automatic control system for maintaining stability at the limits of dynamic driving performance. Sensors continuously monitor the direction, speed, yaw velocity and lateral acceleration of the car. Using this information, PSM is able to calculate the actual direction of travel at any given moment and applies selective braking on individual wheels to restore stability.Rear-axle steering.Rear-axle steering enhances performance and suitability for everyday use in equal measure. The advantage for day-to-day driving: at low speeds, the system steers the rear wheels in the opposite direction to that of the front wheels. This leads to a virtual shortening of the wheelbase. The advantage for sporty driving: at high speeds, the system steers the rear wheels in the same direction as that of the front wheels.Front-axle lift system.The further development of the lift system on the front axle allows more ground clearance at the front of the 911Turbo. More precisely, by 40mm and up to a speed of approx. 35km/h. The system therefore ensures that kerbs, ramps and car park entrances are a sporting challenge of the past.PorscheDynamic Chassis Control (PDCC).PDCC is an active roll stabilisation system. It suppresses the vehicle's lateral body movement during dynamic cornering manoeuvres. A permanently controlled rolling torque distribution between the front and rear axles ensures that the handling is ideally adjusted for every driving conditions. For improved dynamic performance, even more neutral handling and increased ride comfort \u2013 whatever the speed.",

If the system detects a vehicle approaching quickly from behind or one that is in the blind spot, and changing lanes would be too dangerous, it informs the driver with a visual signal in the exterior mirrors. For greater comfort and safety, especially on the motorway. Turn Assist provides support during low-speed turns. Once you've arrived at a junction, Turn Assist issues a visual warning if it detects objects in your blind spots.Night Vision Assist.Night Vision Assist provides you with information when driving at night, even beyond the range of the headlights within the system limits. An infrared camera detects pedestrians or large wildlife before they are illuminated. A thermal image in the instrument cluster warns you: the detected person or animal is highlighted in yellow \u2013 or in red and is accompanied by an audible signal if within the critical range in front of the vehicle. At the same time, the stopping distance control is activated.ParkAssist (front and rear) including reversing camera.The standard reversing camera facilitates precise reverse parking and manoeuvring. Help is provided in the form of the camera image and dynamic guidelines on the PCM screen, which illustrate the predicted course of the vehicle given the current position of the steering wheel.Remote ParkAssist.\u00b9The Remote ParkAssist combines a variety of intelligent assistance systems that make it easier for you to find suitable parking spaces as well as parking itself. Thanks to the Active Parking Assistance, when activated and at the appropriate speed, your 911Turbois able to measure and identify possible parking spaces as you drive past, and \u2013 monitored by the driver \u2013 independently takes over the steering and the forward and reversing manoeuvres of the vehicle during the parking process.\u00b9Only compatible withAppleiPhones from iPhone 7 generation and from iOS 13.0. Please see the compatibility instructions in the Car Configurator. All systems function within their system limits and the driver must constantly monitor the vehicle.Surround View.Surround View supplements the reversing camera with three more high-resolution cameras in the front apron and exterior mirror lower trims. Based on the information supplied by all four cameras, the system generates a virtual bird\u2019s eye view of the car and displays this on the PCM screen. It is also possible to switch between various camera views to improve visibility, e.g. at narrow exits."

        "Chassis.PorscheActive Suspension Management (PASM).PASM is an electronic damping control system that actively and continuously adjusts the damping force on each wheel, based on current road conditions and driving style \u2013 for reduced body roll and thus for improved comfort and increased dynamics.PASM sports suspension.For the first time in the 911Turbomodels, a particularly high-performance PASM sports suspension in combination with a body lowered by 10mm is optionally available. With firm springs, adapted anti-roll bars and a new tuning of the PASM dampers, the PASM sports suspension enables a further improvement in dynamic performance. Without major restrictions on driving comfort.PorscheTraction Management (PTM).The system has been continuously enhanced. It is now more robust and offers improved control. The result: increased precision and resilience.PorscheTorque Vectoring Plus (PTV Plus).This system enhances vehicle dynamics and stability by applying brake pressure to the rear wheels, in conjunction with a rear differential lock. When the car is driven assertively into a corner, moderate brake pressure is applied to the inside rear wheel. Consequently, a greater amount of drive force is distributed to the outside rear wheel, inducing an additional rotational pulse (yaw movement) around the vehicle\u2019s vertical axis.PorscheStability Management (PSM).PorscheStability Management (PSM) is an automatic control system for maintaining stability at the limits of dynamic driving performance. Sensors continuously monitor the direction, speed, yaw velocity and lateral acceleration of the car. Using this information, PSM is able to calculate the actual direction of travel at any given moment and applies selective braking on individual wheels to restore stability.Rear-axle steering.Rear-axle steering enhances performance and suitability for everyday use in equal measure. The advantage for day-to-day driving: at low speeds, the system steers the rear wheels in the opposite direction to that of the front wheels. This leads to a virtual shortening of the wheelbase. The advantage for sporty driving: at high speeds, the system steers the rear wheels in the same direction as that of the front wheels.Front-axle lift system.The further development of the lift system on the front axle allows more ground clearance at the front of the 911Turbo. More precisely, by 40mm and up to a speed of approx. 35km/h. The system therefore ensures that kerbs, ramps and car park entrances are a sporting challenge of the past.PorscheDynamic Chassis Control (PDCC).PDCC is an active roll stabilisation system. It suppresses the vehicle's lateral body movement during dynamic cornering manoeuvres. A permanently controlled rolling torque distribution between the front and rear axles ensures that the handling is ideally adjusted for every driving conditions. For improved dynamic performance, even more neutral handling and increased ride comfort \u2013 whatever the speed.",

If it detects a noticeably wet road surface, the response behaviour of PSM and PTM is prepared accordingly. The system informs the driver of detected wetness and recommends that they switch manually to Wet mode. If the driver activates this, PSM, PTM, aerodynamics, PTV Plus and the responsiveness of the drivetrain are adjusted.\u00b9ThePorscheWet mode is not a substitute for adopting an appropriate driving manner in different road and weather conditions, and is, at the most, an aid for the driver.Collision and Brake Assist.The standard Collision and Brake Assist can reduce the risk of collisions with vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists within the limits of the system. In the first stage, the system uses the front camera to alert the driver both audibly and visually when it detects vehicles, pedestrians or cyclists in the collision area.Automatic distance control.Where system limitations allow, the system regulates the speed of your 911Turbofully independently in line with the speed of the vehicle in front. A radar sensor in the front apron monitors the area in front of your vehicle. If you have selected a cruising speed and begin to approach another vehicle that is travelling in the same lane as you and which is driving more slowly, the system slows the engine or gently applies the brakes. This continues until the distance that you have pre-set is attained.PorscheInnoDrive including automatic cruise control.\u00b9PorscheInnoDrive extends the range of functions of the automatic distance control system by up to three kilometres of anticipatory speed control.

        "Accessories.Roof basket with auxiliary headlights.Ready to hold up to 40 kg: the Tequipment accessories available for the 911Dakar, such as canisters, recovery boards and other luggage, can be securely fastened in the robust aluminium roof basket, featuring a Matt Black powder coating. If the stage lasts into the night, the integrated LED auxiliary headlights light the way through the desert.Canister.Indispensable during every stage: the painted 10-litre fuel canister and the 12-litre plastic canister for drinking water with \"PORSCHE\" logo. Both containers are fixed onto the roof basket with special, easy-to-open canister holders so that no time is lost when refuelling.Recovery boards.Essential for soft ground such as sand and mud: the robust plastic boards in grey with \"PORSCHE\" logo help with recovering the vehicle if it gets stuck, and can be transported in the roof basket.Folding spade.If you dive deep into the endless sea of desert, you need to have the right equipment. The folding spade including axe and saw is a true multifunctional tool \u2013 and should be attached to the roof basket within easy reach on every off-road adventure.Active 2.0 duffle.Extremely robust and water-repellent: this travel bag is made of Grey tarpaulin material with a distinctive \"PORSCHE\" logo in Black. Functional details, such as roll-top closure and practical straps for attaching to the roof basket, make it the perfect piece of kit on all tours.Sticker sets.For the 911Dakar, three additional designs are available as decals that are reminiscent of historicPorschevehicles from the East African Safari Rally of 1971, 1974 and 1978 and can be attached directly ex-works or retrofitted via Tequipment.Roof tent.The foldable roof tent for two people is mounted on the vehicle's roof transport system and can be set up in just a few simple steps \u2013 the best conditions for achieving the top podium position. During the journey, the tent, mattress and ladder are stowed in the hard-shell case.",
        "Interior highlights.Desired limitation.In the desert, there is an infinite number of stars in the night sky. The 911Dakar, on the other hand, is limited to 2,500 units. The aluminium plaque with the limited edition number ensures each car is unique.PorscheExclusiveManufaktur.The fascination ofDakar\u2013 combined with extraordinary craftsmanship. The design of the new 911Dakarwas specially matched to the sporty look of the victorious 1984 953 byPorscheExclusiveManufaktur, and signed with the embossed logo on the storage compartment lid.RallyeDesignExpansion Package.This is no mirage: the expansion package has additional details in Race-Tex including decorative stitching in Blue \u2013 such as the inner sill panelling, the fuse box cover, the vehicle document folder and the central air vent housing with vanes in leather. Another eye-catcher is the shell of the interior mirror, clad in Black Race-Tex with decorative stitching in the same colour.Black aluminium.Exclusiveand sporty: pedals and footrest in forged aluminium with partially Black anodised and nanocoated finish. The milled PDK selector lever combines Matt Black and Silver-coloured aluminium with Black leather inlays.Surround view.When driving off-road, you have to always keep an eye on your surroundings \u2013 and even more so on the ground. Gravel? Branches? Mud? At low driving speeds, the terrain camera shows everything on thePorscheCommunication Management (PCM) display, so the 911Dakarcan also be parked a little further away if necessary.Removal of rear seats.You don't drive a rally with four people, but two. For this reason, the rear seats were deliberately removed from the 911Dakar, saving even more weight on the way to winning a rally stage.",
